_Manage a list of bookmarks using Git_

This repo started off as a static file. In its current incarnation it is a simple ~~Python~~ Node script that
automates the creation of a CSV file that stores a searchable list of bookmarks.

A React client to browse this list is available [here](https://vramdhanie.github.io/resources).
